Committee Management System (Dart) 🎯
The Committee Management System is a Dart-based console application that automates the management of a monthly committee, including member tracking, balance updates, lucky draws, and payment processing using JazzCash, EasyPaisa, or Cash.

🔹 Features & Functionality
1️⃣ Member Management
Predefined members with unique ID, name, balance, and winning status.
Ability to manually add balances for each member before the draw.
2️⃣ Lucky Draw System 🎰
Every month, a random member (who hasn’t won before) is selected.
If all members have won once, the system resets the winners' list.
The lucky draw winner receives the total committee amount (PKR 20,000).
3️⃣ Payment Processing 💰
After the winner is selected, the program asks for a payment method (JazzCash, EasyPaisa, Cash).
Simulates a successful transaction and updates the winner’s balance.
4️⃣ Balance Management 📊
Members' balances are reset after every lucky draw.
Users can manually add funds to each member before the draw.
5️⃣ Interactive Console Input 🖥️
Users can choose whether to conduct the lucky draw each month.
The system displays members’ details before and after each draw.
